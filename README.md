# Project-2
Module 18: Students will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on the organization's web application. Students will exploit the organization's Linux servers, and they'll exploit the organization's Windows servers. The project is structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) style competition, so that each vulnerability that students exploit correlates with a "flag," and flags are worth various point amounts depending on the difficulty level of the exploit.

Module Description
In the second project week, students will use the skills that they have learned in the Offensive Security unit to attack a fictional organization and determine its vulnerabilities. On Day 1, students will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on the organization's web application. On Day 2, students will exploit the organization's Linux servers, and on Day 3, they'll exploit the organization's Windows servers. The project is structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) style competition, so that each vulnerability that students exploit correlates with a "flag," and flags are worth various point amounts depending on the difficulty level of the exploit.

Module Objectives
  
Day 1: Students will be provided a fictional organization's web application that has a variety of vulnerabilities. Students will be tasked with finding flags as they exploit these vulnerabilities.

Day 2: Students will continue to exploit the fictional organization, but will focus on the organization's Linux servers and vulnerabilities related to Linux operating systems. Students will continue finding flags during their exploitation.

Day 3: Students will continue to exploit the fictional organization, but will focus on the organization's Windows servers and vulnerabilities related to Windows operating systems. Students will continue finding flags during their exploitation.

Lab Environment
For the majority of this week's demonstrations and activities, the class will use an Azure Lab that contains each day's activities.

Module Checklist
Before beginning to prep this week's project, be sure you have the following accessible within your lab. Please notify the curriculum team as soon as possible if any of the following is not available.

 Kali

 Win10

 WINDC01

What to Be Aware of:

For each day of this week's project, you will need to create the Capture the Flag environment where the students will enter their found flags.

This environment will also keep score for your students.

Be sure to set this up BEFORE class each day!

Your admin credentials for the CTFd site will be reset each time you update the daily CTF to the following:

user: admin

password: ctfpassword

Note: If the credentials above are not working, it is because the previous user changed it. Please create a /Cyberlabsupport ticket to get the CTFd hosted sites (Project 2) reset. Let the lab support team know which site you are using that needs to be reset.

On Day 1, it is very important that students follow the exact steps of setting up their web application. Specifically, students must pull the most current docker container before bringing it up. The instructions to enable the web application are listed in three steps in their guide.

In addition to a review of the Offensive Security unit, this week's project is also a student competition.

You can choose whether to announce daily CTF winners or cumulative winners over the three days of the project.

If you decide on cumulative winners, be sure to keep track of the team's daily scores, as each day's scores will be lost when you upload the next day's CTF.
